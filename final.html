			<h2> Six States Petition the U.S. Supreme Court to maintain the Block Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan </h2>
			<h4> Why conservative states Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Missouri want to block the Student Loan Forgiveness Plan proposed by the Biden Administration <br>By Arren Cuyler </h4>

			<h3>Data Summary</h3>
			<p>On August 24, 2022, the Biden administration proposed a three-part plan to provide relief for student loan borrowers. The plan included up to $20,000 in debt cancellation for Pell Grant recipients ($10,000 for those who did not receive a Pell Grant), cutting monthly payments in half, and increasing the maximum amount for the Pell Grant. However, six conservative-leaning states, including Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina, have tried to block the proposal from coming to fruition.<br> 
			In theory, this plan sounds like it would be extremely beneficial to those who have accumulated debt through seeking higher education, but this plan could have a negative impact on the economy both nationally and statewide in some states. Data collected by the Education Data Initiative, shows the student loan statistics of each U.S. state, and where the six states in question stack up to the rest of the country.

			<h3>Economy and Government Spending</h3>
			<img src="Student loan image.jpg" alt="" height="150px" width="300px">
			<p>The six conservative states are trying to block the student loan relief plan proposed by the Biden administration due to their political ideology and concerns about the impact of excessive government spending on the economy. One of the primary reasons for these states trying to block the student loan relief plan is their political ideology. Conservative states typically oppose bloated government spending, which is necessary to put this relief plan into action. The state of Iowa, which voted to block the proposal, thinks it will harm the state's and the country's economies.<br>

			According to Peter Orazem, an economist at Iowa State University, "the size of this particular program is large. Therefore, I believe that its impact will probably be greater than the relatively slow overall accumulation of student debt.”<br>

			“The issue,” he continued, “is that there is no production as a result of this spending, even though "more spending is fine if you have production on the other side."<br>

			Orazem added that inflation occurred when the government heavily subsidized the consumer sector of the economy without stimulating production on the other side. Depending on how quickly it is implemented, he cautioned that the student debt relief plan might result in "upward consumer pressure." This would lead to a further increase in inflation, which could harm the economy in the long run.<br>

			Orazem claims that the impact of the relief plan may depend on how quickly it is implemented and could result in inflation, which could harm the economy.<br>

			

			

			It is significant to note that there are both arguments in favor of and against implementing such a plan, and that the effect of student debt relief on state economies is still up for debate. While some experts contend that eliminating student loan debt would actually spur economic growth by releasing funds for consumers to spend on other goods and services, others are of the opinion that it could have a negative impact on the economy and people's ability to pursue higher education in the future.

			<h3>Relief Plan Effect on an Individual Basis</h3>
			<p>The Student Debt Relief Plan proposed by Joe Biden could provide a significant financial benefit to millions of Americans struggling with student loan debt. However, this proposal also raises concerns about its potential impact on inflation and future borrowers.<br>
				First, if the extra money given to borrowers is used for consumption, the plan may raise inflation. If borrowers spend the extra cash on goods and services, the rise in demand might cause a corresponding rise in prices, which would result in inflation. The effect this would have on the economy would depend on how severe and long the inflationary pressures lasted.<br>
				Second, the proposal might also have an impact on upcoming borrowers. Future borrowers might anticipate similar treatment if the government offers debt relief to current borrowers, which could make them less likely to make prudent borrowing decisions. This might encourage reckless borrowing, which might eventually cause a student debt crisis.<br>
				The proposal might also make it harder to find money for higher education. The money that was previously allotted to servicing these debts may no longer be available for future loans if the government forgives a sizable portion of student loan debt. This might make it harder for future students to get financial aid, which might make it harder for them to pursue higher education.<br>
				A large-scale student debt relief plan, according to the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri (MOHELA) and some state officials, would decrease the revenue made by student loan servicers and make it more difficult for them to fund higher education in the state. Due to MOHELA's financial commitment to the state treasury, any decline in revenue may have a direct bearing on the amount of money they are able to allocate for public colleges and universities.<br>

				In turn, this might make it harder for residents of the state to access higher education because fewer funds might be available for scholarships, grants, and other types of financial aid. For people from low-income families who may rely on these types of financial aid to pursue higher education, this could be especially harmful.<br>

				It is significant to note that there are both arguments in favor of and against implementing such a plan, and that the effect of student debt relief on state economies is still up for debate. While some experts contend that eliminating student loan debt would actually spur economic growth by releasing funds for consumers to spend on other goods and services, others are of the opinion that it could have a negative impact on the economy and people's ability to pursue higher education in the future.<br>
				While the Student Debt Relief Plan proposed by Joe Biden could provide relief to millions of Americans struggling with student loan debt, it also raises concerns about its potential impact on inflation and future borrowers. It is essential to carefully consider these potential impacts and develop strategies to mitigate any negative consequences.<br>
